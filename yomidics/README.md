## Netflix.zip/Nameflix/Migaku

Is based off the frequency data that was generated from the Netflix subtitles by Ohtalkwho. Due to the extreme variety of shows on Netflix this one has a completely different orientation and usecase than the small ones I created.
For example: 大阪(Osaka the town) doesn't appear in the Based.zip but has a high ranking in these. Migaku is the frequency.json that was shared for Migaku. Nameflix is based on unidic with Names and Netflix on the unidic list without names.
